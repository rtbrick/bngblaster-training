BNG Blaster Training
====================

The BNG Blaster training is splited into three sections:

1. **Basics**: The first section covers foundational concepts to ensure participants have a solid understanding of the fundamentals.

2. **Access Protocols**: The second section focuses on access protocols such as PPPoE, IPoE, and others, providing insight into how these protocols function in a BNG environment. You will learn how to emulate these protocols using BNG Blaster, including configuring the appropriate settings and generating realistic traffic patterns to simulate real-world scenarios.

3. **Routing Protocols**: The third section explores routing protocols, including BGP, ISIS, and more, helping participants understand how to test routing protocols, scaling, and convergence to evaluate network performance and stability.

In the exercises, there are commands to enter, where the first line starting with `# > ` indicates whether those commands should be entered in the host shell or the RBFS CLI, specifying the required mode (op or cfg).
